# ArtBlock Platform

Platform ArtBlock is a way to create a creator based community that focuses on specific type of art. These communities are a form of DAO.

## Feautures  

1. Users can purchase platform native ERC20 ABX Tokens with a fixed price of ethers.
2. User can create new communities by speending ABX Token.
3. Each community will have their own native ERC20 token which can be exchanged with ABX Token.
4. Each community will have a Decentralized EXchange (DEX) which will have two assets - ABX Token & the community native token.
5. The liquidity pool follows Constant Product Automated Market Maker (CPAMM). The price curve for these AMMs abides by the x*y=k equation, where X and Y are the quantities of assets 1 and 2, and K is a constant.
6. Creators can publish their art in respective communities for approval by staking certain community native tokens. The arts can be of two category - exclusive & general.
7. Community members can be vote on the approval of the product with options for upvote & downvote. The voting is weighted.
8. Artists can host Dutch auctions for approved exclusive items.
9. Auctioned exclusive arts will be minted as Non-Transferable Token.
10. Approved general arts will be minted as NFT.
11. There is an ArtBlock marketplace where creators can sell their general art products in community native tokens & current owners can resell general arts.
12. There is a dynamic royalty system for original creators allowing them to set a percentage for each subsequent rsell.
